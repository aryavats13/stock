# Stock Market Prediction Web App

## Overview
This repository contains a web application for predicting stock prices using machine learning models. The application allows users to select a stock, view historical data, analyze it with moving averages and candlestick charts, and predict future prices using trained models. The app is built using Streamlit and incorporates a combination of Keras and Scikit-learn models for price predictions.

## Features
- **Historical Data Visualization**: Display historical stock data in tabular form.
- **Candlestick Charts**: Visualize stock data using candlestick charts for the past 20 days.
- **Moving Averages**: Plot and compare different moving averages (MA50, MA100, MA200) with the actual closing prices.
- **Price Prediction**: Predict stock prices using a hybrid model combining Keras LSTM and Scikit-learn algorithms.
- **Comparison of Predictions**: Compare predicted prices with actual prices for the last 3 days.
- **Next Day Prediction**: Predict the stock price for the next trading day.
